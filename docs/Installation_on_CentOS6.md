Installation on CentOS 6
=====================

These instructions are largely based on the Python 2.7 guide on [Too Much Data](http://toomuchdata.com/2014/02/14/how-to-install-modern-python-on-centos-6/) and the [MunkiWebAdmin install guide](https://code.google.com/p/munki/wiki/MunkiWebAdminLinuxSetup).

All commands should be run as root, unless specified (via ``su -``).

##Install Prerequisites

### Install Python 2.7

The version of Python that ships with CentOS (2.6) is too old for Sal to run properly, so we are going to install a more up to date one.

Install the development tools:

	yum update
	yum groupinstall "Development tools"
	yum install zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel python-devel httpd-devel gcc

Open up ``/etc/ld.so.conf``:

	nano /etc/ld.so.conf

And make it add the line at the end to make it look like:

	include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
	/usr/local/lib

Make the OS aware of the change:

	/sbin/ldconfig

Download and install Python:

	cd /tmp
	wget http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/Python-2.7.6.tar.xz
	tar xf Python-2.7.6.tar.xz
	cd Python-2.7.6
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-unicode=ucs4 --enable-shared LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath /usr/local/lib"
	make && make altinstall

###Setup the Virtual Environment

Make sure git is installed:

	which git

If it isn't, install it:

	yum install git

Download and install python setup tools:

	cd /tmp
	wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
	python2.7 ez_setup.py

Install Pip

	easy_install-2.7 pip

Install virtualenv

	pip2.7 install virtualenv==1.10.1

###Create a non-admin service account and group
Create the Sal user:

	useradd saluser

Create the Sal group:

	groupadd salgroup

Add saluser to the salgroup group:

	usermod -g salgroup saluser

##Create the virtual environment
When a virtualenv is created, pip will also be installed to manage a virtualenv's local packages. Create a virtualenv which will handle installing Django in a contained environment. In this example we'll create a virtualenv for Sal at /usr/local. This should be run from Bash, as this is what the virtualenv activate script expects.

Go to where we're going to install the virtualenv:

	 cd /usr/local

Create the virtualenv for Sal:

	virtualenv-2.7 sal_env

Make sure saluser has permissions to the new sal_env folder:

	chown -R saluser sal_env

Switch to the service account:

	su saluser

Virtualenv needs to be run from a bash prompt, so let's switch to one:

	bash

Now we can activate the virtualenv:

	cd sal_env
	source bin/activate
	
##Copy and configure Sal
Still inside the sal_env virtualenv, use git to clone the current version of Sal

	git clone https://github.com/salsoftware/sal.git sal

Now we need to get the other components for Sal

	pip install -r sal/setup/requirements.txt

Next we need to make a copy of the example_settings.py file and put in your info:

	cd sal/sal
	cp example_settings.py settings.py

Edit settings.py:

* Set ADMINS to an administrative name and email
* Set TIME_ZONE to the appropriate timezone
* Modify DISPLAY_NAME to what you want the header to be
* This is enough to get you going. See [Settings.md](https://github.com/salsoftware/sal/blob/master/docs/Settings.md) for more options in detail.

###More Setup
We need to use Django's manage.py to initialise the app's database and create an admin user. Running the syncdb command will ask you to create an admin user - make sure you do this! If you are running Sal in a large environment, it is recommended you use MySQL rather than the default SQLite database. If this is the case, follow the [guide on setting up MySQL before continuing](https://github.com/salsoftware/sal/blob/master/docs/Using_mysql_on_CentOS6.md).

	cd ..
	python manage.py syncdb
	python manage.py migrate

Stage the static files (type yes when prompted)

	python manage.py collectstatic

##Installing mod_wsgi and configuring Apache
To run Sal in a production environment, we need to set up a suitable webserver. Make sure you exit out of the Sal_env virtualenv and the saluser user (back to root) before continuing).

	yum install httpd httpd-devel
	chkconfig httpd on
	service httpd start

Now we need to install mod_wsgi:

	cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/config/
	ln -s ../../libpython2.7.so .
	cd /tmp
	wget https://modwsgi.googlecode.com/files/mod_wsgi-3.4.tar.gz
	tar xf mod_wsgi-3.4.tar.gz && cd mod_wsgi-3.4
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
	./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python2.7
	make && make install

Now we're going to tell Apache about our new module.

	nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

And add in:

	LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so

And restart Apache:

	service httpd restart

##Set up an Apache virtualhost
You will probably need to edit some of these bits to suit your environment, but this works for me. Make a new file at /etc/apache2/sites-available (call it whatever you want)

	nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/sal.conf

And then enter something like:

	WSGISocketPrefix /var/run/wsgi
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName sal.yourdomain.com
   	WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/local/sal_env/sal/sal.wsgi
   	WSGIDaemonProcess sal user=saluser group=salgroup
   	Alias /static/ /usr/local/sal_env/sal/static/
   	<Directory /usr/local/sal_env/sal>
    	   WSGIProcessGroup sal
       		WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
       		Order deny,allow
       		Allow from all
   	</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

Now we just need to enable our site, and then your can go and configure your clients (exit back to root for this):

	service httpd restart

If you can't connect, make sure you're allowing port 80 through the firewall:

	iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
	service iptables save
