Installation on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
=====================
This document assumes Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The instructions are largely based on the [CentOS MunkiWebAdmin setup instructions](https://code.google.com/p/munki/wiki/MunkiWebAdminLinuxSetup) by Timothy Sutton.

All commands should be run as root, unless specified.

##Install Prerequisites
###Setup the Virtual Environment

Get your sever up to date:

	apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

Make sure git is installed:

	which git

If it isn't, install it:

	apt-get install git

Install python setup tools:

	apt-get install python-setuptools

Make sure virtualenv is installed

	virtualenv --version

If it's not, install it:

	easy_install virtualenv==1.10.1

###Create a non-admin service account and group
Create the Sal user:

	useradd saluser

Create the Sal group:

	groupadd salgroup

Add saluser to the salgroup group:

	usermod -g salgroup saluser

##Create the virtual environment
When a virtualenv is created, pip will also be installed to manage a virtualenv's local packages. Create a virtualenv which will handle installing Django in a contained environment. In this example we'll create a virtualenv for Sal at /usr/local. This should be run from Bash, as this is what the virtualenv activate script expects.

Go to where we're going to install the virtualenv:

	 cd /usr/local

Create the virtualenv for Sal:

	virtualenv sal_env

Make sure saluser has permissions to the new sal_env folder:

	chown -R saluser sal_env

Switch to the service account:

	su saluser

Virtualenv needs to be run from a bash prompt, so let's switch to one:

	bash

Now we can activate the virtualenv:

	cd sal_env
	source bin/activate

##Copy and configure Sal
Still inside the sal_env virtualenv, use git to clone the current version of Sal

	git clone https://github.com/salsoftware/sal.git sal

Now we need to get the other components for Sal

	pip install -r sal/setup/requirements.txt

Next we need to make a copy of the example_settings.py file and put in your info:

	cd sal/sal
	cp example_settings.py settings.py

Edit settings.py:

* Set ADMINS to an administrative name and email
* Set TIME_ZONE to the appropriate timezone
* Modify DISPLAY_NAME to what you want the header to be
* This is enough to get you going. See [Settings.md](https://github.com/salsoftware/sal/blob/master/docs/Settings.md) for more options in detail.

###More Setup
We need to use Django's manage.py to initialise the app's database and create an admin user. Running the syncdb command will ask you to create an admin user - make sure you do this! If you are running Sal in a large environment, it is recommended you use MySQL rather than the default SQLite database. If this is the case, follow the [guide on setting up MySQL before continuing](https://github.com/salsoftware/sal/blob/master/docs/Using_mysql_on_ubuntu.md).


	cd ..
	python manage.py syncdb
	python manage.py migrate

Stage the static files (type yes when prompted)

	python manage.py collectstatic

##Installing mod_wsgi and configuring Apache
To run Sal in a production environment, we need to set up a suitable webserver. Make sure you exit out of the Sal_env virtualenv and the saluser user (back to root) before continuing).

	apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi

##Set up an Apache virtualhost
You will probably need to edit some of these bits to suit your environment, but this works for me. Make a new file at /etc/apache2/sites-available (call it whatever you want)

	nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/sal.conf

And then enter something like:

	<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName sal.yourdomain.com
   	WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/local/sal_env/sal/sal.wsgi
   	WSGIDaemonProcess sal user=saluser group=salgroup
   	Alias /static/ /usr/local/sal_env/sal/static/
   	<Directory /usr/local/sal_env/sal>
    	   WSGIProcessGroup sal
       		WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
       		Order deny,allow
       		Allow from all
   	</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

If you are running Ubuntu 14, you also need to add in ``Require all granted`` after the ``Allow from all`` line.

Now we just need to enable our site, and then your can go and configure your clients (exit back to root for this):

	a2ensite sal.conf
	service apache2 reload
